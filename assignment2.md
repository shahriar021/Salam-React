# What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?

- package.json:

  This file is mandatory for every project
  It contains basic information about the project
  Application name/version/scripts

- package-lock.json:

  This file is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either the node_module tree or package-json.
  It is generated after an npm install
  It allows future devs & automated systems to download the same dependencies as the project.
  it also allows to go back to the past version of the dependencies without actual â€˜committing the node_modules folder.
  It records the same version of the installed packages which allows to reinstall them. Future installs will be capable of building identical description tree.

# Why should I not modify package-lock.json?

A: package-lock.json file contains the information about the dependencies and their versions used in the project. Deleting it would cause dependencies issues in the production environment. So don't modify it, It's being handled automatically by NPM.

# What is node_modules ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?

A: node_modules folder like a cache for the external modules that your project depends upon. When you npm install them, they are downloaded from the web and copied into the node_modules folder and Nodejs is trained to look for them there when you import them (without a specific path). Don't push node_modulesin github because it contains lots of files(more than 100 MB), it will cost you memory space.

# What is the dist folder?

A: The /dist folder contains the minimized version of the source code. The code present in the /dist folder is actually the code which is used on production web applications. Along with the minified code, the /dist folder also comprises of all the compiled modules that may or may not be used with other systems.

# What is browserslist?

A: Browserslist is a tool that allows specifying which browsers should be supported in your frontend app by specifying "queries" in a config file. It's used by frameworks/libraries such as React, Angular and Vue, but it's not limited to them.
